yasi
====

yasi is yet another stupid installer for Arch Linux built on top [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook.

It based on boring Arch Linux [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) and allows to get a minimal bootable ready-to-use system in several minutes.

Testing
-------

Tested: archlinux-2016.06.01-dual.iso

TODO: add information about host and Ansible version
