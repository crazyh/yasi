yasi
====

yasi is yet another stupid installer for [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook.

It based on boring Arch Linux [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) and allows to get a minimal bootable ready-to-use Arch Linux installation in several minutes.

Testing

Tested: [archlinux-2016.06.01-dual.iso](https://www.archlinux.org/releng/releases/2016.06.01/)
